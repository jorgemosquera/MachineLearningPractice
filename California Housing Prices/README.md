# California Housing Prices
Using the California census data build a model of housing prices in the state.
The model should be able to learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.

The dataset that I will be using is the California Housing Prices Dataset from the Statlib Repository.

1. Longitude.
2. Latitude.
